Some plots for discussion:

![Sample dimensions](fig/exp6/sample_dimensions.png)

![ABC samples superimposed on likelihood](fig/exp6/contour_all_points_superimposed.png)

This is strange.
![Likelihood variogram estimates superimposed](fig/exp6/contour_all_points_variogram_estimates_superimposed.png)

There are some outliers messing things up. I have not investigated how they arise.

![Distance all 1000 samples](fig/exp6/k_distance_all_samples.png)
![Distance 100 best samples](fig/exp6/k_distance_100_best_samples.png)

![MSPE all samples](fig/exp6/mspe_all_points.png)
![MSPE 50 closest points](fig/exp6/mspe_50_closest_points.png)

This is also strange I think. Why do the best samples actually lie in a good place (around the green dot). It would make more sense if they were spread around the red dot.
![Likelihood with optimal k](fig/exp6/contour_optimal_k.png)
