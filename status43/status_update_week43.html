I have been looking a bit at a couple of articles which I wonder if I should spend more time on. One is called &ldquo;New Insights Into Approximate Bayesian Computation&rdquo;, by Biau, Cérou and Guyader. They look at ABC from the perspective of a knn-method, something which sounded interesting based on our last meeting. However, I haven’t really understood the paper yet.

The other one is called &ldquo;Pre-processing for approximate Bayesian computation in image analysis&rdquo;, by Moores, Drovandi, Mengersen and Robert. I was looking for articles on ABC applied to some areas I might know more about then genetics when I found that one. Let <span class="formula"><i>s</i>(<b>x</b>)</span> denote the summary statistics, and <span class="formula"><b>θ</b></span> the parameters we want to estimate. They look at <span class="formula">(<i>s</i>(<b>x</b>)|<b>θ</b>)</span>, or rather <span class="formula">(<i>s</i>(<b>x</b>)|<i>φ</i>(<b>θ</b>))</span>, where <span class="formula"><i>φ</i>(<b>θ</b>)</span> is a function that causes <span class="formula">(<i>s</i>(<b>x</b>)|<i>φ</i>(<b>θ</b>))</span> to have a tractable likelihood, something which <span class="formula">(<i>s</i>(<b>x</b>)|<b>θ</b>)</span> does not have in their case. It is the fact that they are looking at how the summary statistics relate to the that parameters they want to estimate that I found interesting. The paper mentions a number of references that do something similar, which I have not had time look at, and they also mention the concept of adaptive ABC, and again listing a number of references, where various techniques are applied to guide the sampling in the posterior space. I have not gotten so far as to really understanding the paper, for instance I don’t understand how they are using their samples from <span class="formula">(<i>s</i>(<b>x</b>)|<i>φ</i>(<b>θ</b>))</span> yet.

To get to know a bit more about multidimensional scaling, I glanced at one article, Multidimensional Scaling in R: SMACOF, where the authors have created an R-package containing tools and examples.

<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection--1"></a>Continuing with the Gaussian field experiments
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
The problem setting is still that we are given some statistics from a discretized random field. We decide that the field under question is Gaussian random field and has a exponential correlation function, taking parameters <span class="formula"><i>σ</i><sup>2</sup></span> and <span class="formula"><i>φ</i></span>. Last time I was sampling from <span class="formula"><i>p</i>(<i>s</i>(<b>x</b>)|<b>θ</b>, <b>y</b><sub><i>obs</i></sub>)</span>, but I forgot that that my summary statistic, the average over the observations, does not really make sense in this setting, since it is only the observation noise that is stopping every sample from matching the observed sample completly. And since I have now introduced the simplification the there is no observation noise, all the samples matched the observed sample perfectly. So keeping the with the average as a summary statistic, I am now sampling from <span class="formula"><i>p</i>(<i>s</i>(<b>x</b>)|<b>θ</b>)</span>.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
It turns out that the using the average as a summary statistic does not work well, which is as expected I would guess.

I then tried an experiment where I calculated the empirical variogram for each sample, and got an estimate for <span class="formula"><i>σ</i><sup>2</sup></span> and <span class="formula"><i>φ</i></span> in the exponential model, I then took the distance from the estimates to the ones obtained from the empirical variogram for the observed sample. This again gave bad results when comparing it to the truth. I guess the point is that with so few observations, we don’t get a good picture of the truth from the observation points on the actual sample either.
