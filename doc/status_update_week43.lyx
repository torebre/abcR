\begin_layout Standard
I have been looking a bit at a couple of articles which I wonder if I should
 spend more time on.
 One is called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

New Insights Into Approximate Bayesian Computation
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, by Biau, CÃ©rou and Guyader.
 They look at ABC from the perspective of a knn-method, something which
 sounded interesting based on our last meeting.
 However, I haven't really understood the paper yet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The other one is called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Pre-processing for approximate Bayesian computation in image analysis
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, by Moores, Drovandi, Mengersen and Robert.
 I was looking for articles on ABC applied to some areas I might know more
 about then genetics when I found that one.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $s(\boldsymbol{x})$
\end_inset

 denote the summary statistics, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\theta}$
\end_inset

 the parameters we want to estimate.
 They look at 
\begin_inset Formula $(s(\boldsymbol{x})|\boldsymbol{\theta})$
\end_inset

, or rather 
\begin_inset Formula $(s(\boldsymbol{x})|\phi(\boldsymbol{\theta}))$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(\boldsymbol{\theta})$
\end_inset

 is a function that causes 
\begin_inset Formula $(s(\boldsymbol{x})|\phi(\boldsymbol{\theta}))$
\end_inset

 to have a tractable likelihood, something which 
\begin_inset Formula $(s(\boldsymbol{x})|\boldsymbol{\theta})$
\end_inset

 does not have in their case.
 It is the fact that they are looking at how the summary statistics relate
 to the that parameters they want to estimate that I found interesting.
 The paper mentions a number of references that do something similar, which
 I have not had time look at, and they also mention the concept of adaptive
 ABC, and again listing a number of references, where various techniques
 are applied to guide the sampling in the posterior space.
 I have not gotten so far as to really understanding the paper, for instance
 I don't understand how they are using their samples from 
\begin_inset Formula $(s(\boldsymbol{x})|\phi(\boldsymbol{\theta}))$
\end_inset

 yet.

\begin_layout Standard
To get to know a bit more about multidimensional scaling, I glanced at one
 article, Multidimensional Scaling in R: SMACOF, where the authors have
 created an R-package containing tools and examples.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Continuing with the Gaussian field experiments
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The problem setting is still that we are given some statistics from a discretize
d random field.
 We decide that the field under question is Gaussian random field and has
 a exponential correlation function, taking parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma^{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

.
 Last time I was sampling from 
\begin_inset Formula $p(s(\boldsymbol{x})|\boldsymbol{\theta},\boldsymbol{y}_{obs})$
\end_inset

, but I forgot that that my summary statistic, the average over the observations
, does not really make sense in this setting, since it is only the observation
 noise that is stopping every sample from matching the observed sample completly.
 And since I have now introduced the simplification the there is no observation
 noise, all the samples matched the observed sample perfectly.
 So keeping the with the average as a summary statistic, I am now sampling
 from 
\begin_inset Formula $p(s(\boldsymbol{x})|\boldsymbol{\theta})$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It turns out that the using the average as a summary statistic does not
 work well, which is as expected I would guess.

\begin_layout Standard
I then tried an experiment where I calculated the empirical variogram for
 each sample, and got an estimate for 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma^{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 in the exponential model, I then took the distance from the estimates to
 the ones obtained from the empirical variogram for the observed sample.
 This again gave bad results when comparing it to the truth.
 I guess the point is that with so few observations, we don't get a good
 picture of the truth from the observation points on the actual sample either.

 The blue line is the true function that was used to generate the sample,

 Everything is done using an exponential correlation function.

This is just a test setup where the prior values for 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma^{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 used to generate an ABC-sample, were compared with the true parameter values
 (cheating in other words).
 This is kind of what we would want our experimental result to look like:
 The accepted values for 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma^{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 lying in the vicinity of the true values.
