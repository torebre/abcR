title:  "First attempt at SMC ABC for spatial example"
---

Attempting to use SMC ABC algorithm from article on Gaussian field example from the fall.

Here we see the parameters for the particles moving. The run was ended before the wanted epsilon was reached. I have not checked the code thoroughly yet, so there might be bugs.
